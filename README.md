Ken's Apps
=================

These are apps that I have made or contributed to that are still available on the App Store.

## Sundoggy
### Creator/Sole Programmer
Created in **Swift 4.2** and updated to **Swift 5**, Sundoggy shows you the current weather - with an appropriate dog. The source API (Dark Skies) is very accurate, so this isn't simply a cute app, it really is useful. Besides using Apple's Geocoding to let you search for any city in the world, it also has a database of 19,000 airport codes (i.e., LAX, SJC.) The latest version includes a Watch app.

## Sunkitty
### Creator/Sole Programmer
A companion app to Sundoggy, this uses the same code base, but uses different assets.

## Woggle
### Co-Creator/Sole Programmer
Created in **Swift 4**, localized into German, Chinese, and Japanese. A fun, addictive game about a cat.

## My Plate
### One of four engineers
Bug fixes to old code in **Objective-C**, new code written in **Swift**. Added the exercise video feature and revamped onboarding, increasing user retention.

## Go [Verb] Yourself
### Creator/Sole Programmer
Originally written in **Objective-C**, I rewrote the app from scratch in **Swift 3** in 2017. It still uses the same **PHP** backend I wrote several years ago.

## War at Sea
### Creator/Sole Programmer
The first app I wrote from scratch for the App Store, and my very first "calling card." Single player or multi-player using Game Center, localized into German, Chinese, Spanish, and Japanese. Amazingly, even though it hasn't been updated since late 2015, it runs perfectly on an iPhone XS with iOS 12, as well as an iPad Pro.
