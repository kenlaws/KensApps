Ken's Apps
=================

These are apps that I have made or contributed to that are still available on the App Store.

## Venmo
### Member of Technical Team
Most of my work has been on the new Business Profile feature, along with some global UI element work. The app is written in **Swift 5**.

## Sunkitty
### Creator/Sole Programmer
Originally created in **Swift 4.2**, I updated it to **Swift 5**, and now **SwiftUI 2.0**. Sunkitty shows you the current weather - with an appropriate cat. The source API (Dark Skies) is very accurate, so this isn't simply a cute app, it really is useful. Besides using Apple's Geocoding to let you search for any city in the world, it also has a database of 19,000 airport codes (i.e., LAX, SJC.) The new version works with **iOS**, **padOS**, **watchOS**, and now **tvOS**. It also has **widgets**, and a **Siri intent**. Back end written with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

## Sundoggy
### Creator/Sole Programmer
Created in **Swift 4.2** and updated to **Swift 5**, Sundoggy shows you the current weather - with an appropriate dog. The source API (Dark Skies) is very accurate, so this isn't simply a cute app, it really is useful. Besides using Apple's Geocoding to let you search for any city in the world, it also has a database of 19,000 airport codes (i.e., LAX, SJC.) The latest version includes a Watch app.

## Woggle
### Co-Creator/Sole Programmer
